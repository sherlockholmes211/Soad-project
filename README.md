## Problem statement
Despite advances in technology, today's blood bank systems are running in manual system.  As such, there is a  prevalent problem  in the availability of needed blood types.

Health domain is pushing in all directions for providing awareness in advantages of the blood donation by conducting various camps, but still many donâ€™t consider it as their responsibility, how can be these situations overcomed?
